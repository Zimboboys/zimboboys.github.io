Hey! I'm Ethan Zimbelman, a CS student at Cal Poly who also enjoys math and music, as well as helping people.

## college life
I love learning, but not really school.

To make it a little more enjoyable, I joined a club called [Hack4Impact](https://github.com/hack4impact-calpoly) where I help develop software for local non-profits to help make their lives a easier. I am currently serving as the Director of Tech as well as leading one of our project teams.

While I truly enjoy math and all of the beauties that come with it, I found that college math courses weren't too nice to me. This is where I see learning > school. Despite this, I'm still extremely interested in math (primarily numbers) so I use some of the projects I am working on to keep this passion alive.

Outside of the joys of being a student, I've found that music is pretty neat. Being a part of [Mustang Band](https://mband.calpoly.edu), jazz bands, and the music appreciation club has given me plenty to do involving music. I even made a site for Mustang Band that may or may not be published soon!
