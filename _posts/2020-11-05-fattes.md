If you're in the SLO area, get [Fatte's](http://fattesslo.com). Their website
may be a poorly scanned PDF of the menu, but they make up for it with their
pizza. Trust me.

They also force you to buy an even number of pizzas with their buy one get one
free offer. **This is an act of love**. They know how good their pizza is. Here's exactly what you need to say when you call them:

1. 2 medium (or large if you're hungry) pizzas
1. White sauce on both
1. Bacon and mushroom on both

If you think white sauce on pizza sounds strange, I thought so too. Put those prejudices aside and try it. It truly changed my life.
