Thanks for reading my first post! I'm not really sure how you found this, but thanks for checking it out I guess. I'm hoping this can be a place for me to share some of the neat things in math, CS, music, or whatever I find interesting in the future. This is also going to be a portfolio for me, so I hope my works live up to your standards.

This blog/site popped up during the Corona quarintine, so this is basically the child of me and my boredom. If you want to give me feedback on whatever you see, feel free to email me. If I've made a post on it, I'll probably want to want to talk about it!

Hope you have a nice day :)
